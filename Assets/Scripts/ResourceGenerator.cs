/**
 * This class lets you generate ressources on demand while playing
 * Preconditions :
 *  - attached to a GameObject in the scene 
 *  (preferably something evocating a source from which you can get the ressources from, like a mine for stones, a river for fish...)
 *  - the GameObject it is attached to must have a Collider attached, and the Collider should be a trigger
 *  - the list of possible prefabs it can instantiate must be set up
 * Postconditions :
 *  - a prefab is instantiated in the center of the Collider
 *  - while the resource stays in the Collider, it is unaffected by physics
 *  - when the player grabs the resource and makes it exit the Collider, a new resource is instantiated, and the previous resource is now affected again by physics
